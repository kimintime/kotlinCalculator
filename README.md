# Calculator Tutorial App

This is a quick tutorial on how to create a simple calculator app in Android Studio using Kotlin.
It's based on the work of [EasyTuto1](https://www.youtube.com/@EasyTuto1) with some modifications.

The calculator app has the following features:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

Please note that this is a simple calculator app intended to serve as a tutorial. It lacks error handling and other features that a production app would need.
